Hi, I’m Saad—a front-end software engineer—from London, England. I have worked in the web industry for over a decade, and in that time, I have contributed to marketing agencies, startups and larger client-side organisations. To mention some: [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/) (Accenture Interactive), [Feed Agency](https://feed.xyz/) (now DEPT®), [Fjord Agency](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/song/unlock-your-potential) (a part of Accenture Song), [Grassify](https://grassify.co.uk/), [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com/), [IAAF](https://worldathletics.org/) (World Athletics), [River Island](https://www.riverisland.com/), [StubHub](https://www.stubhub.com/), [The White Company](https://www.thewhitecompany.com/), [Virgin Active](https://www.virginactive.com/), [Wonderbly](https://www.wonderbly.com/) and [Zopa](https://www.zopa.com/).

Throughout the years, I have navigated legacy ventures, pioneered greenfield initiatives, and shaped both expansive monolithic applications and succinct website constructs. My contributions span from solo endeavors to collaborative engagements within diverse multidisciplinary teams. With a foundational background in design, I relish my synergies with product aficionados, UX designers, and researchers. This positions me as a design engineer (kinda), infusing a profound technical nuance into our collective pursuits.

While my primary craft lies in the realm of front-end web development, I occasionally venture into back-end territories. I hold a fervent passion for the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), site generators, accessibility, and performance metrics. I value an optimal developer experience, thus gravitating towards application architecture, build tooling, and particularly the nuances of monorepos.

## Teaching and mentoring

In addition to software development, I derive immense pleasure from imparting knowledge and mentoring. Teaching not only fortifies my grasp of new concepts but also imbues me with profound joy.

In the past, I've channeled my instructional endeavors through multiple esteemed organizations. As the Head of Coding at [Ignite Hubs](https://www.ignitehubs.org.uk/), under the aegis of Southwark Council, I crafted a specialized curriculum elucidating web development (spanning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for budding enthusiasts. Orchestrating these educational sessions also afforded me the privilege to mentor fellow adults in their journey to becoming adept instructors. In a collaborative stride with a Scrum ensemble, I spearheaded the rejuvenation of the organization's web application, sculpting its architecture with Vue, Nuxt, and Tailwind.

At Ignite, I further embraced the esteemed role of a supervisor for [The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE)](https://www.dofe.org/), guiding young learners through Harvard's illustrious [computer science (CS50) course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0). This biweekly rendezvous was tailored to aid students in navigating the academic labyrinth, assisting them in deciphering intricate course material and unraveling multifaceted pr
oblem sets.
