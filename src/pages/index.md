## Hello there

I'm Saad, a front-end software engineer from London, England, and this is my digital sanctuary.

Leveraging a rich design heritage, I sculpt the contours of the web, steadfastly tackling accessibility and performance. Recently, my passions are entwined with the captivating realms of static site generators such as [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), the intricate craft of [design systems](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-systems), the dynamism of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and the versatility of [micro-frontends](https://frontendmastery.com/posts/understanding-micro-frontends/).

Learn more [about me](/about/), explore my thoughtfully penned [blog](/blog/), or perhaps, extend your generosity with a [virtual cup of :coffee:](https://ko-fi.com/saadbess).
