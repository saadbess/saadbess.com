I’ve been holding off from releasing this blog for a while now, man does it feel good finally writing this `Hello, world!` post.

I’ve got a lot of content planned for this site. Problem is, it’s all stored mentally. I guess I better learn how to structure a content release schedule.

Over the last couple of years, I’ve been working mostly with React and Next.js. Consumed by their rapid updates and work commitments, I’ve put off writing and content creation, both mediums that I desire very much.

## So what can you expect?

To be perfectly honest with you, I don’t have the full answer to this question. I know, however, that you can expect technical and non-technical posts. I need to map out over a decade of learning and draft things out.

I guess this blog is my way of giving back to the web community.

Let’s begin!
