In a world awash with muted cries, Stood Alaa, with stormy skies in her eyes, Her presence, a spectacle, no one denies, For her power, vast as the endless skies.

Top feminist, in waheesh style so grand, A beacon in darkness, with a fiery brand. With a voice like thunder, she'd take a stand, Making mountains move, shaping sea from the sand.

Her habbal style, now amplified to waheesh scale, Made empires tremble, made tyrants pale. For Alaa didn't whisper, she'd roar and regale, Her tales of justice, where love would prevail.

With every dramatic stride, shadows would flee, The world watched in awe, captivated, set free. In her waheesh manner, a force wild and spree, She shattered chains, setting futures decree.

Ancient walls of bias, she'd tear them apart, With passion and drama, and a lioness heart. The world wasnâ€™t ready, for her explosive art, But Alaa, in her waheesh way, played the part.

Champion for the voiceless, queen of the night, Alaa, with her flair, made darkness alight. Top feminist, in waheesh style, a glorious sight, A testament to courage, and to the power of might.

So in the annals of time, her legend will shine, For Alaa and her waheesh way, truly divine. An icon, a force, where stars would align, For a better world, in her dramatic design.
