Web forms serve as the link between users and applications, providing registration, feedback, or data collection services to customers. But as user interactions become more intricate, simple forms no longer suffice - multi-step forms step in to break long processes into digestible chunks for enhanced user experiences.

In this article, we embark on building an elegant multi-step form using [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) library. With [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) type safety and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), our form will not only look great but also function efficiently.
