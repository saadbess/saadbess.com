## Hello there.

Iâ€™m Saad, a front-end software engineer from London, England and this is my home on the web.

Combined with my design background, I build the web, focusing strongly on accessibility and performance. My recent obsessions are: static site generators like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [design systems](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-systems), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [micro-frontends](https://frontendmastery.com/posts/understanding-micro-frontends/).

Learn more [about me](/about/), browse through the [blog](/blog/) or [buy me a :coffee:](https://ko-fi.com/saadbess).
