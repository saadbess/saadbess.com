Hi, I’m Saad—a front-end software engineer—from London, England. I have worked in the web industry for over a decade, and in that time, I have contributed to marketing agencies, startups and larger client-side organisations. To mention some: [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/) (Accenture Interactive), [Feed Agency](https://feed.xyz/) (now DEPT®), [Fjord Agency](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/song/unlock-your-potential) (a part of Accenture Song), [Grassify](https://grassify.co.uk/), [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com/), [IAAF](https://worldathletics.org/) (World Athletics), [River Island](https://www.riverisland.com/), [StubHub](https://www.stubhub.com/), [The White Company](https://www.thewhitecompany.com/), [Virgin Active](https://www.virginactive.com/), [Wonderbly](https://www.wonderbly.com/) and [Zopa](https://www.zopa.com/).

Over these years, I have worked on legacy projects, greenfield projects, larger monolithic applications and smaller website builds. Some of these contributions were done independently, and some were within larger squads containing various disciplines. Possessing a background in design, I thoroughly enjoy collaborating with product and UX designers and researchers. This allows me to adopt a more of a design engineer role, supplying a source of technical depth to these collaborations.

Primarily working on the front-end of the web, I do sometimes dab into the back-end too. I’m enthusiastic about the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), site generators, accessibility and performance. The developer experience is important to me, so application structure, build tools and architecture are some areas I often work in—especially monorepos.

## Teaching and mentoring

Besides creating software, I find satisfaction in teaching and mentoring. Not only is it one of my ways to learn new things effectively, but educating others provides me a lot of joy.

Previously, I’ve taught through various organisations. While Head of Coding at [Ignite Hubs](https://www.ignitehubs.org.uk/) (through Southwark Council) I built a bespoke curriculum teaching web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to young learners on a weekly basis. Leading these teaching sessions, I also mentored other adults into becoming instructors too. Likewise, teaming up with a scrum team, I led the revamp of the organisation’s web app. I architected the project in Vue, Nuxt and Tailwind.

Through Ignite, I also served as a supervisor on [The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE)](https://www.dofe.org/), coaching young learners through Harvard’s prominent [computer science (CS50) course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0). This was a biweekly event that helped students navigate the course material and solve the various problem sets.

## Podcast

In 2022, I co-founded a podcast called [Life in Tech](https://open.spotify.com/show/5CpnRJqTwRTTa6VDgpgcgk). You can find out more about the podcast [here](/podcast/).

<!-- Based on the [companion website](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) of Andy Bell's talk 'Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager'. It takes over a core functionality: Using Tailwind CSS to generate CSS variables based on design tokens.

Like buildexcellentwebsit.es, this starter uses modern CSS, fluid type & space, flexible Layouts and Progressive Enhancement, wrapped in a basic template, ideal for personal websites and other small projects.

The aim is to hopefully spread the use of this _excellent_ workflow. To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/), [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) and [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).

Edit your preferences (colors, fonts, fluid text sizes etc.) in `src/assets/design-tokens`.
