Earlier this year, I had the distinct privilege of participating in the technical review of ["Eleventy by Example: Create powerful, performant websites with a static-first strategy"](https://a.co/d/a3KXaNB) penned by [Bryan Robinson](https://bryanlrobinson.com/) and published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/).

As Packt's inaugural and sole book on Eleventy, it's encouraging that this offering shines a much-deserved light on this particular technology. Eleventy's enthusiastic community deserves this acknowledgement.

As a technical reviewer, my role was to ensure code illustrations and narrative adhered to stringent standards and practices, and that projects effectively educated readers on its technologies.

Yet, this review takes a different vantage point: that of a reader. As I immerse myself in its pages once again, I approach it with the acumen of a seasoned web developer, eager to hone their expertise specifically in Eleventy.

The book, while succinct in length, provides an expansive collection of projects that harness and magnify Eleventy's capabilities. Spanning just under 200 pages, it comprises 10 chapters, each delving deeper and growing more technically intricate as one progresses through the book.

## Who this book is for

>“This book is for anyone who is looking for ways to ship less JavaScript to the client to create more performant sites while still providing a strong developer experience. You should have a strong knowledge of HTML and CSS and at least beginner knowledge of JavaScript and the Node.js ecosystem, including querying APIs.”
